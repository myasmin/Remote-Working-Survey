# Remote-Working-Survey

An analysis on a Survey on Remote Working Environment of Employees and Managers


## Project Motivation:

Right now, we all know that there is a shift in work environment from Remote to Onsite post COVID. In that case, what would be the change in the employer’s policy making strategies? I wanted to investigate to find out that what might be motivation for the employers to make a change in their working setup!
As mentioned in the @MavenAnalytics website, this Dataset is a “survey on 1,500 remote workers from the Australian state of New South Wales, taken in August-September 2020 and March-April 2021, which aimed to capture the shift in remote work experiences and attitudes during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and gain insights on its long-term implications.”
This is an observational study. The findings that I found are quite interesting in terms of Participants’ preferences on Remote Work, Employers’ opinion and fact check on factors like- pay cut in return of working remote etc.

## Objective of the Analysis:

There were several recommended analyses mentioned in the @MavenAnalytics website while publishing the data. Such as-

* 	How has the COVID pandemic impacted the amount of work done remotely? What can be expected post-pandemic?
* 	Does working remotely positively impact productivity? Are there any other benefits?
* 	How does an employees use of time differ when working remotely vs on-site?
* 	What are the biggest barriers to overcome if remote work becomes the norm in the future?

## About the Data:

The Datasets consists of two time points- Survey in 2020 and 2021. I considered the 2021 data as the most recent one to be appropriate to be compared with the context in 2022.
I had to clean, rename the variables, organize the Data, and code it accordingly using Excel.
For the 2021 Data, I worked on the dataset below-

1. The dataset consisting of all the participants - 2021_Employee and Manager Data,
2. The Dataset where the participants are in the managerial posts, 2021_Managers_Survey (subset of the Master Dataset),
3. I considered a part of the 2020 data to compare the Barriers in 2020 and 2021, 2020_Barriers_Data.

## Summary of the Results:

Some interesting findings that I found from the Dataset is –
* •	Most of the employees agree that they want to work 100% time being on Remote. Participants are not interested in hybrid option (If offered, they intend to spend less than 10% of their working hours on hybrid environment).
* •	Participants are not interested to spend time for commuting and getting prepared for work (36% of the Participants are Couple with dependents and 76% live in Metro area).
* •	The Participants don’t encourage the idea to be offered pay-cuts (68%) in return of remote work liberty. Those who support the idea agreed on 10% pay cut or less.
* •	The most interesting finding is- 51.07% The managers agree that their employees work more in remote (i.e. they work at least 20+ % more on remote).
